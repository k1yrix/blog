**1984.**

the book where orwell criticized the russian government. (at the time)

<font size=8>**__the book where he warned us about control.__**</font>

that is exactly what's going on with the internet today.

thanks united kingdom. you've literally just kickstarted a fucking revolution for control over us. it wasn't about child safety, it was all about survellence and privacy evasion that's waiting for murphy's law to take effect. a ticking time bomb just waiting for bad actors to get ahold of.

## why age verification is a problem

lately, age verification has become a literal -phobia in the entire internet space. age verification is basically this: you use a service, the service (may) ask you to verify your age (whether it's required by law or by service choice) by handing over your face or ID, and then that's it. you're free to go.

sounds something that's cleanly simple, right?

<font size=8>**__wrong.__**</font>

by handing over your PII, face or ID, you are basically entrusting the service of handling data security proper. luckily data protection laws like the GDPR exists, but that's not going to stop services from ignoring that law.

you've seen the news, you've seen the scares of age verification. discord's third party is a prime example of how to **not** properly handle data security. you literally have left 70k+ IDs dating back years of tickets out for the hackers to take it and use it in identity theft.

<font size=5>**__that is exactly what happened.__**</font>

not only that, but persona, a third party that powers AV on several websites like roblox, is currently in a lawsuit for misuing data for whatever the crap is going on in that lawsuit. unacceptable.

## it was never about protecting the children

the number one excuse for implementing age verification in a service globally was to "protect the children" from all those harmful stuff that they shouldn't see or would otherwise keep them safe from suspicious activities like random stranger meetups.

while that sounds like a great reason on paper, it really isn't the case.

## now age verification is destorying platforms

roblox was the number one thing that was talked about regarding age verification recently. back in november, they revealed [plans](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/age-checks-to-access-chat-studio-team-create-and-links-on-roblox/4079702/) of introducing "age groups" and that they will be **SEGERGATING** chat based on the age groups.

did it work? did chat levels stayed the same after it got enforced?

<font size=5>**__no it did not.__**</font>

in fact, it has gotten worse.

and despite all the

**THEY DID NOT LISTEN.**

the platform utterly destoryed and chatting rates dropped exponentially by 60-70% because of this horrible update.
