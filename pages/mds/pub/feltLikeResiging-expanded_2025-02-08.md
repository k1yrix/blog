## edit to expand

I still think that this rant shouldn't have been created in the first place, but I would like to take the oppertunity to expand this a little longer to give some other thoughts.

after someone posted a video on a discord server called `"The 5 WORST Mistakes SCR EVER Made"` by `PotatoLemon` (the video in context: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpY69ZbpucY), I want to edit some of my thoughts on what needs to change on the leadership of things.

### what am I trying to say here
basically, I do agree with what potatolemon is saying here. at 20:34 in the video, people want toby to resign, but potatolemon suggests the following instead of toby resigning:

- bring back innovations director, and move toby over to that role
- move zotto over to community director, since he has been active in the community a lot
- appoint a new operations director

to me, I think saying that "there should be new leadership" is a bit overkill without giving some further clarification. as I said, I do agree with this compromise without having to bring in all new people for all of the roles here.

- if we knew toby wants to focus on development, they should've just moved him over to ID when bantech resigned
- if ben is willing to interact with the community, then so be it. take toby's place.
