# Taking a break from the SCR Community as a whole

---

hello scr wiki community.

given the momental amount of heavy controversey that has been happening for the past two months AND **more-or-so recently**, for the sake of my mental health and everything, I will be temporarily stepping away from the scr wiki.

## why? what motivated me to step away for now?

[this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rShpGZ_Qu2NQAEdlyOZa55-r01A_lpHcFNbDiMwa-PM/edit?tab=t.0) from elysiraa basically motivated me. it's very juicy, it's filled with so much details of what has been *really* going on bts, but I feel like this is just more of this is just half pointing fingers and half talking about the state of scr. still, this is just outrageous how all of this is going down.

I've also outlined the state of scr as well in [my other blog post](../../htmls/pub/feltLikeResigning_2025-02-07.html) in my discussion of why I almost resigned.

## how long?

it's probably best for me to step away for a month. in the meantime, I'm going to move discord servers out from the main rotation into the bottom of my server list just so I don't have any hesitation to touch on it. (or I could just leave idk)
