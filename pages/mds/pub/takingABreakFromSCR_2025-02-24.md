# Taking a break from the SCR Community as a whole

---

hello scr wiki community.

given the momental amount of heavy controversey that has been happening for the past two months in the general scr community AND **more-or-so recently**, for the sake of my mental health and everything, I will be temporarily stepping away from the scr wiki. (I still have no intent to resign)

## why? what motivated me to step away only temporarily?

[this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rShpGZ_Qu2NQAEdlyOZa55-r01A_lpHcFNbDiMwa-PM/edit?tab=t.0) from elysiraa basically motivated me. it's very juicy, it's filled with so much details of what has been *really* going on bts (including leaking sv chats wow), but I feel like this is just more of this is just half pointing fingers and half talking about the state of scr. still, this is just outrageous how all of this is going down.

I've also outlined the state of scr as well in [my other blog post](../../htmls/pub/feltLikeResigning_2025-02-07.html) in my discussion of why I almost resigned from my post in the wiki.

## how long?

it's probably best for me to step away for a month OR until v2.2 release, whichever comes first. during that time, I'm going to move discord servers out from the main rotation into the bottom of my server list just so I don't have any hesitation to touch on it. (or I could just leave the servers for now idk)

## what if there's an issue on the wiki and no other staff is available?

feel free to contact me for **emergencies only** that is **only related to the wiki itself or the wiki discord** and **only if no other staff is available**. otherwise, please don't bother me at this time.
