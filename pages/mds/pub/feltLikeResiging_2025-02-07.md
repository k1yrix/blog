I did not feel like wanting to make this blog post, but considering the recent events that has been happing recently, I felt it was necessary to draw this up now.

## disclaimer
I'm not resigning. this letter has <b><i>no correlation</i></b> with the wiki <b><i>at all</i></b>. I'm just delivering a letter reguarding the state of SCR as we all know it. I still have some pride to the community, but all of this neglegence and incompitence by the leaders just wants me to leave the SCR community as a whole.

## background
almost everyone should basically know this by know, but if you have been living under a rock for the past month, to give some starting context of what's going on, the state of the community in SCR has been at its lowest point than it ever was before now. recently, there has been several resignations among SCR's staff that has led to a community fall off. more notably, community manager atom and engagement manager volt recently resigned because of the following common reasons:
- the directors have been neglegent of their feedback
- they were understaffed
- work pressure
- and unhealthy environment in general

this has caused people to start losing trust in SCR's leadership, more specifically towards Toby and behind-the-scenes Charlie.

## why I almost \[look at the title]
once I saw the letters, I became so frustrated over what has been <i>actually</i> going on behind the scenes. after we saw Charlie resigned, we just thought <i>business will just go as usual</i>, but that's false. v2.1 arrived, a new gamepass has appeared, people are mad, and chaos erupted. leadership continues to ignore our feedback, concerns, criticisms, etc. at this point, I could just call SCR's leadership a fucking dictatorship while it's supposed to be a good and stable leadership. (could be a little extreme, but I'm just trying to emphasize some points here) all they want to do is just focus on one aspect and that's it. nothing more, nothing else.

I still had a good amount of pride left in this community before the letters were sent out, but now that pride went down the drain tenfold. I just felt I don't want to be here anymore, I don't want to get involved in this mess in any way possible, I don't want to see the game go rot in hell (because I want to see this game grow more). I just <b>want to get the hell out of here and don't look back at what the leadership have created.</b>

## what needs to be changed
if they want to keep the community in a stable shape, there needs to be new leadership <b>ASAP</b>. a lot of us are not going to stand here and let leadership continue to ignore our concerns and feedback. we want people who is able to take care of the community and bring balance to the leadership hierarchy.

take scr update tracking for example. their administration team just had some recent controversy over *its* leadership following its founder's resignation. it's fortunate that their system was built so well that the founder reinstated himself as owner just to redo the entire administration team. now **that** is something that we want to see, but, as mentioned somewhere before, with charlie still doing BTS stuff and while SCR is still on *his* hands of technicality, the chances of this happing is probably unrealistic. (not saying it's not possible, but it can happen eventually)

(edit: check the [extended](#edit-to-expand) section of this)

## final words
I think that the stakes are so large that the game can't die regardless, but I don't think the community will be able to survive with a broken leadership of what we have right now. maybe in a few years the community aspect will be <u>completely</u> ignored as a whole. (that's just an overstatement for dramatic effect, it would be unrealistic for this to happen) 

that is all I have to say, so y'all have a nice day now ya'hear?
