# I almost felt like resigning from the SCR Wiki

I did not feel like wanting to make this blog post, but considering the recent events that has been happing recently, I felt it was necessary to draw this up now.

## disclaimer
I'm not resigning. I'm just delivering a letter reguarding the state of SCR as we all know it. I still have some pride to the community, but all of this neglegence and incompitence by the leaders just wants me to leave the community as a whole.

## background
to give some starting context of what's going on, the state of the community in SCR has been at its lowest point than it ever was before now. recently, there has been several resignations among SCR's staff that has led to a community fall off. more notably, community manager atom and engagement manager volt recently resigned because of the following common reasons:
- the directors have been neglegent of their feedback
- they were understaffed
- work pressure
- and unhealthy environment in general

this has caused people to start losing trust in SCR's leadership, more specifically towards Toby and behind-the-scenes Charlie.

## why I almost \[look at the title]
once I saw the letters, I became so frustrated over what has been <i>actually</i> going on behind the scenes. after we saw charlie resigned, we just thought <i>business will just go as usual</i>, but that's false. v2.1 arrived, people are mad, and chaos erupted. I still had a good amount of pride left in this community before the letters were sent out, but now that pride went down the drain tenfold.

I just felt I don't want to be here anymore, I don't want to get involved in this mess in any way possible, I don't want to see the game go rot in hell (because I want to see this game grow more). I just <b>want to get the hell out of here and don't look back at what the leadership have created.</b>

I'm just going to say this: this letter has <b><i>no correlation</i></b> with the wiki <b><i>at all</i></b>.
