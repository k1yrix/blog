# I am pissed.

**please do not harrass anyone mentioned on this blog post**

I felt like it was necessary to make this blog post because I am pissed over what happened today.

so someone in the stepford county railway community decided to make a video that contained **leaks** regarding the next major content update, more specifically, version 2.2. at first, these images were believable and it contained more information about the update, but there are some problems.

## what were the leaks?
before I reveal what went wrong, here's a description of each of the leaks were:

1. three of the images contained being in an stepford central.
2. another was taken in four ways.
3. another was taken with the 756 in its full form

## how are they fake?

1. the image with four ways, it shows ben driving the class 756. the problem about ben is that his avatar is backwards. who the fuck would be driving a train backwards???? no one. AND his avatar WASN'T in the sitting posure either.
2. in the angle with the 756 with three signals, yeah who's idea was it to copy and paste the signals without changing its ID. one of the signals are labeled `M128`, which suggests the MORGANSTOWN BRANCH IN AN `Sxxx` ZONE. NOT LOGICAL.
3. another angle that contained a class 345 with a signal. yeah that's the same as the other ones. who would've thought of showing three (maybe) four signals in a row that IS THE SAME SIGNAL ID. ALSO: THE OHLE IS INCOMPLETE. HOW CAN THE TRAINS RUN ON UNELECTRIFIED TRACK????

I'm not sure if the 756 is legit or not, but sure enough that the others are fake.

## I don't understand, how this video pissed you off?

so about a few weeks ago, when scr published the april fools update, they put construction sites for metro. included on those construction barriers that still persists today, there was a safety poster that included metro's full form logo. I decided it would be a great idea to redraw that damn thing myself after giving up on finding the font of that logo.

I did and decide to make the files public to everyone on the scr discord, the scr wiki, and the scr subreddit. I was happy how people are now using it, being featured on concept drawings/caps, fan advertisements, and etc. and I was cool with that.

that is until today. this guy thought it was a good idea to make fake leaks to farm content on his youtube channel. what got me REALLY pissed off is how the logo I redrew (that I mentioned earlier) was used on these fake leaks. when I realized it was fake, I was sort of pissed. I really don't understand how people will go out of their way to make fake content in order to gain attention and farm on it.

### "but kirby, you said you can do whatever, however you want the logo to be used, even without credit"
yeah I said that, but I seriously didn't expect that the creativity would go *this* far. the fake content wasn't even explicitly mentioned it was fake. I know I have waived my right to this and I know that it should be waived because it isn't copyright elgible. **I know how copyright works**, but I felt like that I am starting to regret putting the files out to the public in the first place.

I put it out there for people to use in creative stuff, but not like *this* to farm content out of it. I know I can't do anything about this now because it's PD, but I can remove the files from *new* people to use. I mean I was the one who distributed it, so I can go and delete the messages and shit.

### "yeah, but what if they just redrew the logo themselves?"
probably most unlikely. I know this because most probably don't have the patience and skill to achieve this much accuracy than I could. I ***had*** the patience and skill to do this, and from what I'm aware, ***I*** am probably the only person in this community to do so. and since this can be used uncredited because it's intentionally in PD, this can be went unchecked, but as autistic as I am, I had to check in and see what's going on every so.

I think I am done with the ranting for today.

by the way, I'm not going to do anything really. I'm just angry over how the use of the redrawn logo is being used to farm content before the update even gotten released.
